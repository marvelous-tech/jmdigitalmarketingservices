                        agree that your comments will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive or obscene
                        material, or contain any computer virus or other malware that could in any way affect the
                        operation of the Service or any related website. You may not use a false e‑mail address, pretend
                        to be someone other than yourself, or otherwise mislead us or third-parties as to the origin of
                        any comments. You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take
                        no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.
                        <br/><br/><strong>SECTION 10 - PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> <br/>Your submission of personal

                        risk. The service and all products and services delivered to you through the service are (except
                        as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any
                        representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all
                        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a
                        particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement. <br/>In no case shall J. M. Digital
                        Marketing Services, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors,
                        interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any
                        direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind,
                        including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data,
                        replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including
                        negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any
                        products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of
                        the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any
                        content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any
                        content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if
                        advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                        the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or
                        jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. <br/><br/><strong>SECTION
                            14 - INDEMNIFICATION</strong> <br/>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless J. M.
                        Digital Marketing Services and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers,
                        directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns
                        and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees,
                        made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the
                        documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a
                        third-party. <br/><br/><strong>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</strong> <br/>In the event that any
                        provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such
                        provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
                        and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such
                        determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining
                        provisions. <br/><br/><strong>SECTION 16 - TERMINATION</strong> <br/>The obligations and
                        liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination
                        of this agreement for all purposes. <br/>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until
                        terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by
                        notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site.
                        <br/>If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any
                        term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time
                        without notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of
                        termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof). <br/><br/><strong>SECTION
                            17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong> <br/>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or
                        provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
                        <br/>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in
                        respect to The Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and
                        govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements,
                        communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not
                        limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). <br/>Any ambiguities in the
                        interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.
                        <br/><br/><strong>SECTION 18 - GOVERNING LAW</strong> <br/>These Terms of Service and any
                        separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in
                        accordance with the laws of Canada. <br/><br/><strong>SECTION 19 - CHANGES TO TERMS OF
                            SERVICE</strong> <br/>You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any
                        time at this page. <br/>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to update, change or

                        Service constitutes acceptance of those changes. <br/><br/><strong>SECTION 20 - CONTACT
